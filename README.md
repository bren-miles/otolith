Fourier analysis of otolith morphometrics with Momocs

Skeleton R code for simple otolith morphometric fourier analysis

Can be used to:

- Identify fish species based on otolith morphology

- Identify fish population/subpopulation based on otolith morphology

- Generate images from otolith files

**Adding further statistical analysis in progress**

Made possible through the Momocs package: Bonhomme V, Picq S, Gaucherel C, Claude J (2014). Momocs: Outline Analysis Using R, volume 56 number 13. https://www.jstatsoft.org/v56/i13/.
